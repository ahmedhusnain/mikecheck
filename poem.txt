Love is a gentle breeze,
That fills our hearts with ease.
It's a feeling so profound,
In every sight and every sound.

Love is a guiding light,
That shines through the darkest night.
It's a warmth that never fades,
In the embrace of love's serenades.

Love is a dance of two,
Creating a bond that's true.
It's a melody that sings,
In the harmony that love brings.

Love is a journey, never-ending,
With twists and turns, always ascending.
It's a story that unfolds,
In the love that forever holds.

Love is a gift, pure and divine,
A treasure that's yours and mine.
It's a force that knows no end,
In the love that we transcend.

So let love be our guiding star,
No matter where we are.
For in the depths of love's embrace,
We find solace, joy, and grace.
